# MoviesDataBase
# in order for this to work you need to:
1. Perform these SQL querries:
CREATE DATABASE movies; 
CREATE TABLE `movies`.`actor_info` ( `actor_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,  `actor_name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL ,    PRIMARY KEY  (`actor_id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
CREATE TABLE `movies`.`film_info` ( `film_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , `film_name` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL , `film_year` INT NOT NULL , `film_format` VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY (`film_id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
CREATE TABLE `movies`.`film_actor` ( `film_id` INT NOT NULL , `actor_id` INT NOT NULL ) ENGINE = InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE `film_actor` ADD PRIMARY KEY( `film_id`, `actor_id`);
ALTER TABLE `actor_info`DEFAULT  CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
ALTER TABLE `film_info` DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
